# Your Health Guide (دليلك الصحي)

A Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to transform healthcare management in Egypt by providing an intelligent, accessible digital health companion for patients with chronic conditions.

## 🏆 Hackathon Project - GDG Alexandria 2025

This project was developed for the GDG Alexandria Hackathon (July 2025) to address critical healthcare challenges in Egypt through innovative technology solutions.

## 🩺 Problem Statement

Egyptian patients with chronic diseases face significant challenges:

- **📝 Illegible Prescriptions**: 78% of handwritten prescriptions contain at least one error, leading to medication mistakes
- **📊 Inconsistent Tracking**: 62% of patients don't track their vitals regularly, making disease management difficult
- **🏥 Inefficient Doctor Visits**: 85% of consultations rely on patient memory rather than accurate data
- **📱 Digital Divide**: 65% of elderly patients struggle with complex health apps, creating barriers to digital health adoption
- **🔌 Connectivity Issues**: Intermittent internet access in many areas prevents reliable use of cloud-based health solutions

## 💡 Our Solution

### System Architecture
```
User Devices <-> Cloud CDN <-> [Cloud Storage, Cloud Run] <-> [Cloud SQL, Vision AI, Vertex AI, Twilio API]
```

### Data Flow
1. **Prescription Processing**:
   - Image upload → Cloud Storage → Vision AI → Data extraction → Database
   - Processing time: < 5 seconds
   - Accuracy: >95% for printed text, >85% for handwriting

2. **Vitals Logging**:
   - Form submission → API validation → Database
   - Offline support with sync queue
   - Conflict resolution for offline edits
